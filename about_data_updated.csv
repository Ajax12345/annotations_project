http://publishing.com/about-us,How it all started
http://publishing.com/about-us,2016
http://publishing.com/about-us,Testing the waters
http://publishing.com/about-us,"While attending community college and working as Chinese food delivery drivers in New Jersey, twin brothers Christian and Rasmus realized getting a degree so they could eventually work an unsatisfying 9-5 job the rest of their lives did not sound like an attractive life plan."
http://publishing.com/about-us,2017
http://publishing.com/about-us,The start of a business
http://publishing.com/about-us,"By the end of the summer, Rasmus and Christian were making enough money from their books to move out of their parents house, so they quit their jobs, dropped out of college, and booked one-way tickets to Chiang Mai, Thailand. Their biggest motivation for building a business online was so they could travel and experience all the most amazing places across the world."
http://publishing.com/about-us,2018
http://publishing.com/about-us,Launching on YouTube
http://publishing.com/about-us,"Christian & Rasmus move to Hawaii and Christian starts turning his books into audiobooks and selling them on Audible.

http://publishing.com/about-us,2020
http://publishing.com/about-us,Publishing.com
http://publishing.com/about-us,"Publishing.com is born as the twins hire their first 3 team members to help manage and coach their growing community of online publishers. At this point, the AIA program has helped over 100 people worldwide to make full time income with book publishing on Amazon and Audible. Rasmus and Christian both get married and Rasmus first son is born."
http://publishing.com/about-us,2020

https://sunlogix.com,FAQs
https://sunlogix.com,What is the difference between Solar leases vs. Solar PPAs?
https://sunlogix.com,"Solar PPA stands for Solar Power Purchase Agreement and you pay for power generated by solar panels when you pay some money down and you receive a flat rate or yearly increase on your PPA electricity and can benefit for tiered rates.

Solar Lease means you usually have no money down and pay a flat leasing fee that rises every year by a certain percentage, in addition to the leftover utility bill. With this option, you can take advantage of tiered rates as well."
https://sunlogix.com,How often should I service my HVAC system in this region?
https://sunlogix.com,"Given the extreme temperatures in the Coachella Valley, we recommend servicing your HVAC system at least twice a year. A spring check-up for your air conditioning system ensures it’s ready for the summer heat, while a fall service for your heating system prepares it for the cooler winter months. Regular maintenance can prevent unexpected breakdowns and extend the life of your HVAC system."
https://sunlogix.com,How does a home solar system work?
https://sunlogix.com,Understanding how solar energy works
https://sunlogix.com,"is simple. Solar panels absorb the energy the sun emits and converts it into the energy we need to power our cars, homes, and more."

https://sunlogix.com,What are tiered utility rates?

You are distributed a certain amount of power (kilowatt-hours) in each tier. Once you have reached your maximum amount in the tier, you move into the next highest tier."
https://sunlogix.com,How many solar panels will my home need?
https://sunlogix.com,Depending on the size of your home depends on the design and amount of
https://sunlogix.com,solar panels
https://sunlogix.com,"you may need. The number of panels you need depends on the size of your home, how much energy you use on average, how much solar radiation you receive, and how much direct sun hits your roof."

https://vitalcp.com/about/,About Us
https://vitalcp.com/about/,Who We Are
https://vitalcp.com/about/,"The team at Vital Contingent Planning (VCP) has provided labor relations and contingency planning consultation since the 1990s. Our executive team has actively supported employers, particularly healthcare facilities, nationally on projects ranging from bargaining units with 30 members to 3000+ members. For more than three decades, we have stood strong with our clients at their greatest times of need."
https://vitalcp.com/about/,"Our industry experience and strategic methodology enables us to guide clients from a position of strength beginning with the planning phases through the conclusion of a new ratified collective bargaining agreement or union-led labor action. We believe in long-term partnerships with our clients, which are built on transparency, honesty, integrity and our deep industry knowledge."
https://vitalcp.com/about/,Testimonials
https://vitalcp.com/about/,Vital Contingent Planning took the time to understand what our hospitals needed during our contingency planning phase and were there to help us convey a message to our union that we were prepared in the event of a labor action. VCP was instrumental in our ability to negotiate a fair collective bargaining agreement with our union.

http://b2csp.com/about-us,About B2
http://b2csp.com/about-us,"The number 1 question in the world of business for the last 50
									years is how do I get capital for my growing business?"""
http://b2csp.com/about-us,"We are a group of people who believes that businesses should not only have access to
								capital but to the correct
								capital for their business. In the unsecured capital industry we see businesses get
								unfair offers all the time
								due to the fact business owner do not know how to navigate the financial industry and
								its different levels. Not
								getting the most efficient offer for your business means not being able to maximize
								profits."
http://b2csp.com/about-us,"B2 Capital created a solution where we built relationships with the highest tier funding
								partners who are the most
								competitive in each sector while being in touch directly with the business owner and
								understanding what the business
								needs are in order to grow most efficiently. This allows B2 Capital to always provide
								the highest dollar amount,
								the longest terms and lowest rate for the tier which your business belongs to
								curently."
http://b2csp.com/about-us,"The business owner does not only get to benefit from our relationships but we make sure
								to negotiate on their behalf
								and push for what the business owner believes will be the best option to help the
								business grow. We are here to be a funding
								partner for the long term with you, therefore our interest is to make sure your business
								is growing."
http://b2csp.com/about-us,"Send in your application and get assigned to a Senior Consultant who will be your
								advocate in the rough world of Unsecured
								Business Capital. We will focus on your funding while all you need to do is focus on
								growing!"

https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,Our
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,mission
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,.
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,"Dossier was founded out of a desire to make premium fragrances accessible to everyone. As scent enthusiasts ourselves, it became impossible for us to turn a blind eye to the price markups traditionally seen in the industry. Whether it be marking up scents because of celebrity endorsement fees or pricey packaging, we realized perfumes were being sold for way more than they cost to make."
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,Read more.
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,"Its time to say goodbye to feeling lost or left behind when it comes to experiencing premium fragrances and to welcome a new way to shop; your own. With Dossier, enjoying clean, ethically sourced, long-lasting, high-end perfume is within reach."
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,"For those who feel overlooked by the industry, who are tired of fragrances being an investment, or who are curious about stepping into a new way of consuming perfumes, we cant wait to take the journey with you."
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,What
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,we stand for.
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,Transparency.
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,"We are open about our operations and empower our community with honest, valuable information about the industry and our products. From giving you all the details on the sourcing of our ingredients to being upfront about our pricing, we do things differentlyno smoke and mirrors."
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,Craftsmanship.
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,"We never sacrifice quality or cut corners. Ever. While we may price our perfumes below what youre accustomed to, with every bottle of Dossier perfume purchased, youre receiving the highest-quality perfume sourced from Grasse, Francethe perfume capital of the world. Our perfumers have the highest standards and values in mind and we use higher concentrations than most famous brands to ensure a long-lasting effect."
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,You are enough.
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,"In an industry that notoriously feeds on insecurities and profits from making us feel like we lack something only they can supply, we wont dictate trends or tell you which scents are best for you. Try the scents that ignite your senses and make your own rules."
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,Perfume for all.
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,"Access to premium fragrances shouldnt be a privilege for just the 1%, but the norm for all. We strive for fairness and believe in offering high-quality fragrances at a price you can afford."
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,Team
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,clean.
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,"Fragrance reflects who you are. At Dossier, we want our perfumes to do more than make you feel good. We want them to be good. For you and for the planet."
https://dossier.co/pages/about-us,"We follow strict U.S. and U.E. cosmetic safety recommendations when formulating our products, which are ethical, sustainable, and sourced from the highest quality ingredients. Our vegan and eco-friendly fragrances are 100% non-toxic and cruelty-free so you can indulge guilt-free."

http://moversshakers.co/about-us,What do you get when you cross a Broadway performer & director with a Harvard MBA marketer?
http://moversshakers.co/about-us,Movers+Shakers was born in 2016 as a collaboration between Broadway performer & director Geoffrey Goldberg and marketing expert Evan Horowitz. When Geoffrey posted
http://moversshakers.co/about-us,a dance video
http://moversshakers.co/about-us,"on Facebook to the tune of 30k views nearly overnight, Evan saw the potential for Geoffreys genius storytelling to produce fresh, standout marketing."
http://moversshakers.co/about-us,"After proving the power of connecting brands to culture through original music, the pair rapidly expanded the agencys expertise. Movers+Shakers was among the very first agencies on TikTok in 2019, and continues to push its clients into new frontiers across social media and culture."

A self-admitted workaholic who spends most of his time doing deals and managing his team, he does find time to learn, teach and give back. He served on the board of the Realty Investment Club of Houston, has educated fellow investors at local meetings and is proud to be a part of a small, prestigious and invite-only group comprising Houstons top real estate investors.

https://blazysusan.com/about/,Blazy Founder
https://blazysusan.com/about/,"Blazy Susan brand was the brainchild of our founder and CEO, Will Breakell. Will is a young entrepreneur from Roanoke, Virginia. Although Will graduated from the esteemed Virginia Military Institute, he soon realized that he was meant to take a different path than the majority of his peers. The mountains of Colorado were calling for him, and so was the emerging cannabis industry."
https://blazysusan.com/about/,Blazy was Born
https://blazysusan.com/about/,"One day, while sitting on his couch looking at his cluttered coffee table, Will had an epiphany; thus, the original"
https://blazysusan.com/about/,Blazy Susan
https://blazysusan.com/about/,"was born. A few short years later, and here we are! The company has grown to reach all over the world, and is revered by our extremely supportive community of customers and fans."
https://blazysusan.com/about/,Giving Back
https://blazysusan.com/about/,"Blazy Susan wouldnt exist without YOU, so we take pride in giving back to the amazing community. As a brand, we stand for equality and empowerment. We know that the community and industry we are a part of is often unfairly judged and criticized, as are its members. We hope to be a glowing example of how to operate and lead the way in this uncharted territory."

https://www.optifunder.com/mission?hsLang=en,A Pioneer in Warehouse Management for Residential Mortgage Originators
https://www.optifunder.com/mission?hsLang=en,OptiFunder was created to bring mortgage bankers and warehouse lenders together to optimize selection and streamline the historically manual process of funding mortgage loans.

https://www.optifunder.com/mission?hsLang=en,Simplifying Warehouse Funding
https://www.optifunder.com/mission?hsLang=en,Mortgage bankers rely on multiple warehouse lines of credit for short-term financing to fund mortgage loans until they are sold in the secondary market.
https://www.optifunder.com/mission?hsLang=en,"Each warehouse line has unique terms, capacity limits, and constraints making it difficult for the lenders funding departments to know where to fund each loan."

https://www.optifunder.com/mission?hsLang=en,Optimizing Warehouse Allocation Decisioning
https://www.optifunder.com/mission?hsLang=en,Static decision trees and allocator tools are notoriously ineffective and not designed to consider the ever-changing production environment of loans entering the pipeline daily and settling throughout the month.
https://www.optifunder.com/mission?hsLang=en,"OptiFunder solutions help the lender make the optimal decision of where to fund every loan, with submission of data and documents to warehouse partners at the speed of business."

Since then, Woxer has evolved into a brand thats synonymous with self-empowerment through comfort. But we couldnt have done any of it without our amazing customerswho constantly advocate both for themselves and for Woxers place in the market."
https://woxer.com/pages/about-us,"I created Woxer because I wanted to wear underwear that represented me and actually felt comfortableyet for some reason boxer underwear for us didnt exist. At the time, there wasnt even anything resembling anti-chafing underwear or anti-wedgies underwear on the market."

https://blackboxsafety.com/pages/about-black-box-safety,About Us
https://blackboxsafety.com/pages/about-black-box-safety,"Black Box Safety is authorized by manufacturers to distribute the following safety equipment including eye, face, and head protection; hearing protection; respiratory protection, hand protection, foot protection, and high-visibility garments such as vests and jackets, safety apparel that provides protection from electrical energy (arc flash and arc blast), fire and heat, punctures and cuts, and bloodborne pathogens."
https://blackboxsafety.com/pages/about-black-box-safety,We specialize in the prevention of serious injury in the workplace.
https://blackboxsafety.com/pages/about-black-box-safety,How We Do It
https://blackboxsafety.com/pages/about-black-box-safety,"Black Box Safety gives companies timely access to expertise that existing staff may lack time or skills to supply. It counters the tendency toward one-size-fits-all solutions created when safety managers, who typically make equipment purchase decisions, lack time or knowledge to conduct effective risk assessments or evaluate highly technical products and rely instead on recommendations from distributors of safety equipment."
https://blackboxsafety.com/pages/about-black-box-safety,"Distributors, who do not have daily experience with the company, rely on manufacturers reps for product recommendations, but reps are two degrees distant from the companys actual needs and primarily focused on sales. As each person looks to another for crucial information, detail is lost, increasing the potential for money wasted on solutions that go unused or, worse, provision of insufficient or even incorrect solutions, leading to safety failures."

https://inxeption.com/about,The Inxeption Story
https://inxeption.com/about,The leader in industrial commerce
https://inxeption.com/about,"Inxeption is digitizing the global Industrial Commerce value chain through vertical marketplaces for supply chain, powered by a robust industrial search engine and digital infrastructure platform. With Inxeption, suppliers operate a more efficient and connected sales channel, and buyers gain access to vetted sellers, procurement financing and streamlined order fulfillment."
https://inxeption.com/about,Doing business better from the beginning
https://inxeption.com/about,"Three veteran software entrepreneurs - Farzad Dibachi, Mark Moore, and Terry Garnett - founded Inxeption on the manufacturing floor of Noribachi, an LED lighting company. It was 2017, and the founders were burdened by the Industrial Commerce status quo: the manual building of purchase and sales orders that were disconnected from downstream fulfillment processes. Seeing an endemic issue in the industry, they started creating the first release of Inxeption, which brought these industrial transactions online."
https://inxeption.com/about,A history of innovation & challenging the norm
https://inxeption.com/about,"Inxeption's founders have long been associated with startups and technology. Farzad Dibachi, Mark Moore and Terry Garnett first worked together in the early days of Oracle, where Farzad helped pioneer networking computing. Mark was part of the Oracle Database Kernel Development team,which built the modern version of the Oracle database. Terry served on the Executive Management Committee at Oracle."
https://inxeption.com/about,"In 1998, Farzad brought Mark and Terry together again to start the Niku Corporation, an IT management and governance software company. Farzad and his team took Niku public on NASDAQ two years later. Niku's value tripled on its first day as a public company. Farzad stepped down as Niku's chairman, CEO and president in 2005 when Computer Associates acquired the company for $350 million."
https://inxeption.com/about,"Farzad began another business in 2012 - this time with his wife, Rhonda. Noribachi, a custom LED lighting manufacturer specializing in industrial and commercial applications, became the fastest growing LED lighting companies in North America."
https://inxeption.com/about,Farzad Dibachi
https://inxeption.com/about,CEO & Co-Founder
https://inxeption.com/about,Farzad Dibachi was the founding CEO of a series of innovative software companies including Diba and Niku (which Goldman Sachs took public in a $7 billion IPO) as well as the LED manufacturing company Noribachi.
https://inxeption.com/about,"He began his career at Oracle Corporation, where he rose to senior vice president of Oracle's New Media Division, and he led product development and marketing teams that created the fundamental infrastructure needed to digitize content and distribute it online. He holds a B.S. in mechanical engineering and a B.A. in computer science from San Jose State University."

https://legendaryladylabs.com/pages/about-us,"It all started when Kalli wanted to find a good company to recommend to her millions of followers, but was coming up empty-handed. So instead of compromising on her and her clients healthusing sub-par products, she helped createLegendary Lady Labs."
https://legendaryladylabs.com/pages/about-us,"Kalli said this when asked about why she started this company, ""I wanted products that not only I would want to use, but that I could also recommend to my own mother. And there just wasn't any company doing it right. So instead of waiting for one to come around, I decided to start one.And with the help of world class formulators and medical professionals, we've created some of the best products around the globe. We scour the globe finding only the best ingredients and suppliers. Then we test relentlessly until we get it right. It's a lot of work and time but knowing that I'm using and recommending the best products for my clients helps me sleep at night."""

http://lula.life/company#team,Our Story
http://lula.life/company#team,"In 2020, property managers across the country were struggling keep up with maintenance due to the labor shortage and supply chain disruptions. Enter Lula, whose vendor network and sourcing solutions provided relief for residents and managers all over. The issues that plagued the industry for years were all brought to light when the world shut down due to the pandemic. This disruption provided Lula with a path to reinvent property maintenance forever."
http://lula.life/company#team,"Once we found where we were most needed and fully committed to servicing rental properties, our core business skyrocketed. In the last 3 years, we grew to over 40 employees, 10x our revenue, expanded to 30+ markets (and counting), were named the top work order management solution of 2023, and ranked in the top 125 of the Inc 5000."

https://redlablogistics.com/about-us/,ABOUT US
https://redlablogistics.com/about-us/,OUR STORY
https://redlablogistics.com/about-us/,"It was 2019 in the hot and humid campus at the University of South Carolina, three college roomates – Addison, Nick and Toby – found themselves restless as their senior year would be over in a couple of months. They knew that soon they would be entering the workforce but weren’t quite sure what they wanted to do as a career. However, they were certain about one thing – they wanted to make an impact."
https://redlablogistics.com/about-us/,"Nick had worked around logistics on a couple of occasions and had somewhat of a top level understanding of the industry. Addison, on the other hand, had entrepreneurial experience from starting his own lighting company back in Highschool. Together, one night at dinner in Myrtle Beach, they decided to put their skills and ideas together and give it a go."
https://redlablogistics.com/about-us/,"As they started to get to work, they realized they had one last piece of the puzzle missing and brought in Toby who had a Supply Chain background and a knack for sales. They now had the finance know how in Addison, Operations in Nick and Sales in Toby and were ready to go."
https://redlablogistics.com/about-us/,"At the start, it was a tough road. They spent countless hours studying the industry’s ins and outs, working day and night to weave networks, systems, and processes into place. Often, they spent more time at their house in Columbia than class, but they were determined to make a name for themselves in the emerging industry."
https://redlablogistics.com/about-us/,"It wasn’t long before their hard work started to pay off. Word of their refreshing youthfulness, dedication and attention to detail spread, and customers began to take note. In the beginning, it was difficult to gain the trust of clients, but once they saw the three young entrepreneurs’ work ethic and commitment to the job, everything changed."
https://redlablogistics.com/about-us/,"As they pushed further ahead and brought in more and more clients, something interesting started happening. Their customers became more than just customers  they became mentors. These relationships strengthened not only their business but also their connections with people in the industry. They could ask for advice from those who had decades of experience, and they were happy to offer guidance and share their connections with the young entrepreneurs."
https://redlablogistics.com/about-us/,"The company began to grow at a rapid pace, thanks to their honest and determined work ethic. The more they worked, the more they learned, the more they excelled. They built a business model that was successful, enabling their clients to put their trust entirely in the hands of their growing team."
https://redlablogistics.com/about-us/,"In just four short years, their passion and hard work have transformed their company into an industry leader, quickly becoming one of the fastest-growing private companies in the country. They’ve built upon the firm foundations of their mentors, surpassing their initial goals and aspirations. Hard work and ethics remain the bedrock of their company, and they continue to strive to make an impact in the logistics industry. Today, Addison, Nick and Toby look to continue their growth and feed on their growing hunger in the ever lasting pursuit of perfection."
https://redlablogistics.com/about-us/,We have been surrounded by the transportation industry for our entire lives. We have seen the unethical practices of many businesses and watched them fail. Relationships and trust are paramount.

With no external investors or large debts to answer to, we can remain true to our values and make decisions that align with our commitment to delivering the best experience possible."

https://redlablogistics.com/about-us/,Story Behind the Name: Red Lab
https://redlablogistics.com/about-us/,"Red Lab Logistics was named after one of the owner’s dogs, Bently. Bently, a Red Labrador, has been a source of inspiration for the company as he exemplifies qualities that are at the core of Red Lab Logistics’ values. Bently displays unwavering loyalty to his owners and a persistent desire to serve them in any capacity possible. He is also incredibly adaptable, easily modifying his behavior to better serve the needs of those around him. These qualities embodied by Bently have been incorporated into the Red Lab Logistics’ business model, enabling the company to operate with the same level of loyalty, persistence, and adaptability that is demonstrated daily by the well-loved canine that initially inspired the company’s name."

https://erepower.com/about/,Who Are We?
https://erepower.com/about/,"Here at Earth Right Mid-Atlantic, our team is focused on giving you the best experience possible. That starts with honesty, education, and realistic expectations. We are based out of Lynchburg, VA and service folks all over Virginia, from the coast to the hills. Our mission is that through honest and transparent conversations, we make energy efficiency improvements and solar solutions simple and affordable so that you and others can reap the benefits of smarter cleaner energy."
https://erepower.com/about/,Our Promise
https://erepower.com/about/,"At Earth Right Mid-Atlantic we believe that honest works reaps honest rewards. That is why education and transparent information are key parts of our process. The solar industry is growing fast as people recognize the value of solar. Unfortunately this has attracted some companies looking to make a quick buck. They operate by using misinformation or lack of information in order to sell systems that are not accurately sized or reasonably priced. That method is not sustainable and frankly not right. We believe in working with you to customize packages to exactly what you need; not more and not less. We want you to be informed, do your research, and find what is right for you and your home. Instead of just buying an energy efficiency or solar package for your home, we want you to be a part of a growing community that is both saving the planet and saving money by cutting energy waste."

https://partakefoods.com/pages/about-partake,Championing Food Inclusivity
https://partakefoods.com/pages/about-partake,"Created in 2016 by Founder and CEO Denise Woodard, when her daughter was diagnosed with multiple food allergies, Partake exists to offer a selection of delicious, allergy-friendly foods that those with and without food restrictions can enjoy and share with confidence. All offerings are certified gluten-free, non-GMO, vegan and are free of the top 9 allergens (wheat, tree nuts, peanuts, milk, eggs, soy, fish, sesame and shellfish)."
https://partakefoods.com/pages/about-partake,Fighting Food Insecurity
https://partakefoods.com/pages/about-partake,"Food allergies affect 1 in 13 children across the country, and (according to foodallergy.org) Black children are at a significantly higher risk of developing these allergies. Passionate about getting safe food into the hands of food insecure families, Partake partners with organizations like No Kid Hungry to provide access to the food, education and advocacy these families deserve."
https://partakefoods.com/pages/about-partake,Opening Doors for HBCU Students
https://partakefoods.com/pages/about-partake,"As a Black & Asian American woman, Denise is passionate about raising awareness of Black and female entrepreneurship and increasing opportunities for underrepresented people seeking careers in the food and beverage industry. In 2020, Denise founded Black Futures in Food & Beverage, an annual fellowship program that mentors HBCU students and helps them secure internships and jobs at the programs end."

https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,Meet the sisters Behind Baltic Born
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,Together we started Baltic Born because we were looking for pieces that we felt comfortable in through all the different stages of our lives as women and without breaking the bank.
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,Meet the sisters Behind Baltic Born
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,Together we started Baltic Born because we were looking for pieces that we felt comfortable in through all the different stages of our lives as women and without breaking the bank.
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"3 Sisters, 1 Goal: To create beautiful and timeless styles that allow all women to be empowered and confident at every stage of life.The Baltic Sea has a history that is entrenched in discovery, war, and rebirth. It has been called a symbol of power, described as the connector for trades, and unites the countries that share the shoreline. 
Through its turbulent history, this body of water continues to unite the people and countries who depend on it for their livelihood."
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"As three sisters with Scandinavian heritage, we chose to build a business that celebrated our own history and mirrored the symbolism of the Baltic Sea. We each have navigated life on different paths, in ever-changing bodies, and have loved and celebrated how each of us are so unique. No matter what life has brought us, we are constantly evolving and growing, which has challenged us and brought us closer together."
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,Shop Baltic Born Exclusives
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"We started Baltic Born to empower the women in our community, near and far, to navigate their own path each day at a time. We want our community to feel beautiful, confident and comfortable to conquer their own goals and passions. As a team, we custom design the majority of our pieces with our communitys needs in mind and hand select items from brands and wholesalers that we trust."
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,Allison
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"is the oldest of the three sisters and is a busy mom on the go. Allison's inspiration for Baltic Born started when she and her husband of eleven years began an adventure where in 9 years they lived in 10 cities. She continually was the new-one to the neighborhood, which grew her understanding and need for sisterhood and how important it can be to have a strong bond with her community."
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"Each day she motivates the Baltic Born team to be innovative, and keep the customer's needs at the center of all decisions! She loves being a mom and a wife, but the satisfaction she gets from creating designs for women all over the world that make them feel beautiful from the inside out definitely brings tears to her face weekly! Reading all the messages from customers that come in of how beautiful their Baltic Born dress made them feel is the fuel for her work! She loves helping women feel confident and worthy of loving themselves."
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,What is something you wish everyone knew about Baltic Born?
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"Baltic Born is more than just an idea, but rather part of our heritage. Our grandfather introduced us to the industry. As kids we loved to visit him at his men's clothing store. From a young age he would show us how to measure suits, pick fabric, and emphasised the importance of putting the customer first. But this started long before our grandfather, in the 1800s our Scandinavian ancestors were designing and tailoring clothes for their community and even for the Danish king. The birth of Baltic Born was just a matter of time!"
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,What is something that people dont know about you?
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,I am bilingual. I had the opportunity to live in Denmark for a year and half and am still fluent in Danish. I absolutely love Danish culture and still host aebleskivers and Christmas dinners focused on all my favorite Danish foods!

https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,Angela
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"is the middle sister and has been the driving force behind Baltic Borns growth and passion. Angela is our go-to gal to navigate circumstances where there is no clear path forward, and finds solutions when challenges seem impossible. She is our visionary and is constantly motivating all of us to be the best version of ourselves."
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"Angela loves to travel. From one of her first international trips she began noticing the beauty and confidence of a woman on the go. She saw how a simple design and style could make any woman feel confident and empowered no matter the zip code, country code, or terrain. She recognized this confidence as she crossed borders, she saw it in varying body shapes and phases of life. As she herself wears many hats, she knew that this is what she wanted for the customers of Baltic Born."
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"Youre called to do something brave, whats the first thing you do?"
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"I take a deep breath and think about my son who means the world to me. I always think of how my decisions may impact him. I also might reach for a Diet Dr. Pepper, as that is my go-to destresser then send a group text to the sisters to weigh in. Each of us have incredibly different opinions on almost everything, so I want to make sure I have considered all possibilities. IF theres one thing Ive learned running this business, its that three brains are better than one!"
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,What is the biggest lesson learned from starting Baltic Born with your two sisters?
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"To believe in yourself. Many people do not know that it was a hard path for us to get to where we are now. I know I had many sleepless nights with a newborn as did Allison, and Marianne was essentially working two full time jobs. There were so many times it would have been much easier to give up. But we believed in ourselves, and we pushed each other to keep going even when it got hard. There are definitely days that we did not get along, but at the end of the day we all believe in each other and that will keep us moving forward."

https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,Marianne
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"is the youngest sister and is the catalyst of Baltic Borns creativity and style. From a young age, Marianne began dressing up her dolls in chic mix and match ensembles, and fixing their hair to look better. This critical eye propelled her into starting her own successful business and became an award winning hair stylist. As many true artists can see their designs before a single line is put on canvas, Mariannes creativity and eye for detail has propelled Baltic Born into a brand that cannot go unnoticed."
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"Marianne has prompted Baltic Born into a space of asking What if? What if we offered bridesmaids dresses in complementary tones for all body shapes and sizes? What if we were to style all of our clothes, so it was easier for our customers to buy and wear? Marianne has pushed the boundaries of how we used to shop for clothes by taking out the guessing game of how will this look on me? and instead used her brilliance to ensure each customer can wear Baltic Borns clothes with confidence."
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,Give us a snapshot of an ordinary moment in your life that brings you great joy?
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"With the hustle of owning a business and working at a fast pace, I really enjoy my downtime. An ordinary moment in my life that brings me a lot of joy is a night in with my husband. Just the two of us, making a home cooked meal together (pasta is our favorite) then relaxing on our couch. I of course need to be wearing a pair of my matching pajamas, and he might be catching up on the days sports highlights. Just thinking of that moment brings me joy."
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,What is something that people often get wrong about you?
https://balticborn.com/pages/about-us,"I tend to observe and listen to the environment around me. I often dont speak up, because I am putting together a puzzle of all the information in my thoughts. So sometimes, people think that I am quiet, but I am often just listening for meaning or intent."
