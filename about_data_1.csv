A note from our Founder
"“As long as I can remember, people thought I was stupid, lazy, or unmotivated. I started to believe it. In school, I would read the same page over and over again, without absorbing anything. At 16, I dropped out of high school and went to work at a sandwich shop."
"Fast-forward ten years — I scored in the 99th percentile on the GMAT and earned Master’s degrees from Yale and INSEAD. Nootropics turned everything around for me, and helped me form the positive habits that I built my success on. Once I balanced my brain chemistry, I could perform like never before."

"Were growing to provide crucial healthcare, everywhere."
"Developing strategies at health plans, she faced the gap-in-care challenge year after year. He founded and ran a screening company and saw how difficult it was to reach patients. Together, Coral S.

"Progress in our mission put us in the perfect position to help in 2020 when COVID-19 hit. From that first White House meeting of the minds, we moved mountains to set up testing at retailers, stadium parking lots and other convenient locations around the country."
"Today, we are proud to be a certified woman-owned business, and were thrilled to continue our mission, potentially saving millions of lives and billions of dollars through convenient testing that helps every person understand where they are in their health journey and where they need to go  their personal true north."

2016
How it all started
2016
Testing the waters
"While attending community college and working as Chinese food delivery drivers in New Jersey, twin brothers Christian and Rasmus realized getting a degree so they could eventually work an unsatisfying 9-5 job the rest of their lives did not sound like an attractive life plan."
2017
The start of a business
"By the end of the summer, Rasmus and Christian were making enough money from their books to move out of their parents house, so they quit their jobs, dropped out of college, and booked one-way tickets to Chiang Mai, Thailand. Their biggest motivation for building a business online was so they could travel and experience all the most amazing places across the world."
2018
Launching on YouTube
"Christian & Rasmus move to Hawaii and Christian starts turning his books into audiobooks and selling them on Audible. They quickly become his best-selling books and he makes over $10,000 per month. The Mikkelsen Twins YouTube channel is born. After posting a video every other day for 6 months talking all about book and audiobook publishing, they reach 1,000 subscribers."
2018
Audiobook Impact Academy
"Audiobook Impact Academy 1.0 is launched in September and 96 students join on the first day. The twins end the year traveling to Mexico, UK, Italy, Greece, Egypt, and then finishing off in Bali where they stayed for the next 8 months."
2019
AIA 2.0
"The majority of the year is spent just filming YouTube videos and creating Audiobook Impact Academy 2.0. They travel to Australia, Lombok, Komodo Island, Japan, Cuba, Croatia, Spain and Denmark."
2020
Publishing.com
"Publishing.com is born as the twins hire their first 3 team members to help manage and coach their growing community of online publishers. At this point, the AIA program has helped over 100 people worldwide to make full time income with book publishing on Amazon and Audible. Rasmus and Christian both get married and Rasmus first son is born."
2020
Getting published
"In July 2020, Rasmus and Christian are published in Entrepreneur magazine, and then in Forbes magazine in December."
2021
"Over $10,000,000 in revenue"
"Publishing.com takes off as thousands of new students join the program. By the end of the year, over 15,000 students are discovering the freedom of publishing."
2021
The Freedom Shortcut
"The Freedom Shortcut is released, selling over 9,000 copies in the first week and becomes a Wall Street Journal Best Seller."
2022
From small business to established company
An explosive year of growth results in over 40 new hires positioning Publishing.com as the leading education company in the self-publishing industry.
2023
Inc. 5000
"Publishing.com is nationally recognized as one of the fastest growing private companies in America, placing 19th on the Inc. 5000 list."

About B2
"The number 1 question in the world of business for the last 50
									years is how do I get capital for my growing business?"""
"We are a group of people who believes that businesses should not only have access to
								capital but to the correct
								capital for their business. In the unsecured capital industry we see businesses get
								unfair offers all the time
								due to the fact business owner do not know how to navigate the financial industry and
								its different levels. Not
								getting the most efficient offer for your business means not being able to maximize
								profits."
"B2 Capital created a solution where we built relationships with the highest tier funding
								partners who are the most
								competitive in each sector while being in touch directly with the business owner and
								understanding what the business
								needs are in order to grow most efficiently. This allows B2 Capital to always provide
								the highest dollar amount,
								the longest terms and lowest rate for the tier which your business belongs to
								curently."
"The business owner does not only get to benefit from our relationships but we make sure
								to negotiate on their behalf
								and push for what the business owner believes will be the best option to help the
								business grow. We are here to be a funding
								partner for the long term with you, therefore our interest is to make sure your business
								is growing."
"Send in your application and get assigned to a Senior Consultant who will be your
								advocate in the rough world of Unsecured
								Business Capital. We will focus on your funding while all you need to do is focus on
								growing!"

Our
mission
.
"Dossier was founded out of a desire to make premium fragrances accessible to everyone. As scent enthusiasts ourselves, it became impossible for us to turn a blind eye to the price markups traditionally seen in the industry. Whether it be marking up scents because of celebrity endorsement fees or pricey packaging, we realized perfumes were being sold for way more than they cost to make."
Read more.
"Its time to say goodbye to feeling lost or left behind when it comes to experiencing premium fragrances and to welcome a new way to shop; your own. With Dossier, enjoying clean, ethically sourced, long-lasting, high-end perfume is within reach."
"For those who feel overlooked by the industry, who are tired of fragrances being an investment, or who are curious about stepping into a new way of consuming perfumes, we cant wait to take the journey with you."
What
we stand for.
Transparency.
"We are open about our operations and empower our community with honest, valuable information about the industry and our products. From giving you all the details on the sourcing of our ingredients to being upfront about our pricing, we do things differentlyno smoke and mirrors."
Craftsmanship.
"We never sacrifice quality or cut corners. Ever. While we may price our perfumes below what youre accustomed to, with every bottle of Dossier perfume purchased, youre receiving the highest-quality perfume sourced from Grasse, Francethe perfume capital of the world. Our perfumers have the highest standards and values in mind and we use higher concentrations than most famous brands to ensure a long-lasting effect."
You are enough.
"In an industry that notoriously feeds on insecurities and profits from making us feel like we lack something only they can supply, we wont dictate trends or tell you which scents are best for you. Try the scents that ignite your senses and make your own rules."
Perfume for all.
"Access to premium fragrances shouldnt be a privilege for just the 1%, but the norm for all. We strive for fairness and believe in offering high-quality fragrances at a price you can afford."
Team
clean.
"Fragrance reflects who you are. At Dossier, we want our perfumes to do more than make you feel good. We want them to be good. For you and for the planet."
"We follow strict U.S. and U.E. cosmetic safety recommendations when formulating our products, which are ethical, sustainable, and sourced from the highest quality ingredients. Our vegan and eco-friendly fragrances are 100% non-toxic and cruelty-free so you can indulge guilt-free."

Team
green.
"Weve also nailed the packaging. We use recyclable, environmentally friendly materials for our packaging which helps our planet and saves you money. Win-win!"
All our returned perfumes are donated to charity for a fully eco-friendly and ethical sales process.

Your
Dossier fam.
"Based in New York, but spread across three continents, we love to bring together viewpoints and perspectives from all over the world into our brand."
"France particularly runs deep within our veins. With five perfumers located in Grasse and our nose/evaluator located in Paris, you cant have Dossier without that French touch."
"We see our customers as a vital part of our team, which is why we are always looking for new ways to connect. We listen to your suggestions, we develop scents based on what you love, and we always have an open ear to help us improve the Dossier experience."

About Us
"At MOXFIVE, solving problems is who we are and what we do. Our team operates at the intersection of IT and cybersecurity helping organizations of all types solve their most challenging technology-related problems. Day in, day out."
Let Us Help
OURSTORY
"When we started MOXFIVE, we set out to fundamentally change how organizations obtain the technical expertise they need to make the best decisions for their business  whether in response to a security incident or in taking proactive measures to harden their environment and minimize the threat of an incident. Through years of first-hand experience working for and building traditional professional services firms,"
we knew there was a more effective way
to provide organizations the help they need when they need it most.
Our vision was to create the
"MOXFIVE Platform,"
a virtuous cycle where our technical expertise is coupled with an ecosystem of specialized providers to build a more scalable approach that allows us to deliver a better customer experience. We focus on solving the problem at hand  not meeting financial targets. Our goal is to get our clients exactly what they need more efficiently so they focus on what truly matters - their business.

now an
everyday obstacle course.
"Staying informed means wading through thousands of headlines, ads, and op-eds, all driven by one goal. To be loud. To continuously catch your attention and keep it. But that's why we started 1440"

Our Name
Our Story
1440
is the daily news briefing followed by millions of readers. But it began as an email we sent to 78 people.
"Every morning, we'd wake up to the same broken media landscape. Filler content. Talking heads. Opinions. Infotainment. But one day, instead of repeating the cycle, we started working on a solution: a comprehensive news source"
edited to be unbiased as humanly possible.
A daily briefingin one simple email. For more insight. And less outrage.
"We're an employee-owned news source, not affiliated with any larger media outlet."
Our Mission
To share fact-focused information with the world.
Because
3 million
people trust us to be unbiased as humanly possible.
"Our readership spans the political spectrum, with roughly 33% affiliated with the left, 33% with the right, and 33% as independent."
Our Standards
"To deliver facts without motives, we commit to these guiding principles every day."
1440 Standards
Human first.
We prioritize people and community. Because understanding the world enables personal growth and engaged citizenship. It helps us be better to each other.
Transparency and accountability.
"Publishing facts without motives requires honesty. From how we make money, to our editorial process  if you have a question, please ask. We answer every message."
Relentless curiosity.
"We're driven by a never-ending passion to learn. A relentless desire to understand our community. Country. World and universe. To express this, we ask questions."
1440 Editorial Standards
Consequential news only.
"We don't waste your time with speculative or opinion-based stories. 1440 shares the news that has a significant impact on people, places, or communities."
Facts and action. Not just words.
"We will never cover a news story about any person, political or otherwise, based on cherry-picked quotes. Or a story based on what a person is thinking."
Context. Not interpretation.
Not a newsflash: our readers are smart. So we provide the tools and links to dig deeper. We publish the details that help connect the dots.
1440 Partner Standards
Alignment with our mission.
Our mission: to share fact-focused information with the world. We choose our brand partners based on mutual alignment and shared values.
High quality is a requirement.
Brands we place into the daily briefing must have an existing customer base with a strong reputation for consistent quality.
No miracle products. No motives.
"We rigorously score and vet potential brand partners. So you'll never see ads from political campaigns or entities, tobacco brands, or any bait & switch products."

A self-admitted workaholic who spends most of his time doing deals and managing his team, he does find time to learn, teach and give back. He served on the board of the Realty Investment Club of Houston, has educated fellow investors at local meetings and is proud to be a part of a small, prestigious and invite-only group comprising Houstons top real estate investors.

260 Acres Near Alvin
Purchase Price:
"$550,000"
Return on Investment:
2.3x
Project Duration:
18 months
"This deal was extremely successful with high cash-on-cash returns despite a longer than expected timeline. We sold larger tracts, mostly on owner financing, although a large buyer came in and bought some for cash."

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>This deal was a huge success. Cash-on-cash returns were extremely high. They would have been even higher had Doug taken on bank financing instead of paying cash. Took longer than expected because we needed to trade land with the neighbor, and that dragged on. Sold somewhat larger tracts of varying acreages, such as: 19, 23, 24, 25, 31, and 43. Most sold on owner financing. A large buyer came in and bought some for cash.</p>"

Were
overachievers
and proud of it
We know: Good enough is how the world works. But its not how we work.
"Weve been called perfectionists, nerds, and pedants. Weve been told we care too much, even by the people who pay us."
Maybe we do. But we also know its what makes us different. We wrestle over Oxford commas and spend hours pouring over Google Analytics. And were OK with that because our work is better for it.
Dont worry: Were more down to earth than we seem on paper. We ride bikes to work. We love a team lunch out. We watch sappy Hallmark movies.
"Were never-content content creators, but were also a lot of fun. Get to know us."
Misty Larkins
President
"Misty is the living embodiment of our work hard, play harder value. Her Disney themed tattoo sleeve and collection of Jordan 1s make her arguably the coolest member of the team."
Will Erlandson
Chief Growth Officer
"Will is an early riser who values a good morning routine. He likes surfing, udon noodles, white tea, and acoustic guitars."
Emma Kessinger
Senior VP of Accounts
"Emma is the friendliest introvert youll ever meet. Her happy place is cuddling with her two dogs, a good book, and a Starbucks latte."
Courtney Burton
Growth Strategy Manager
"Courtney believes having a positive attitude and compassion for others goes a long way. When shes not in the office, youre likely to find her spending time with her family, cheering on the Chiefs, or hiking with her THREE dogs; And no, thats not a typo."
Kendall Lappe
Senior Growth Strategist
"Kendall is an energetic problem-solving planner. Outside of work, you can find her planning a happy hour, trying new food with her friends, relaxing by the waterside, or hanging with her 3 catsScooter, Evander, and Max and her dog, Tula. She hates cooking (though she is is quite good at it), loves planning trips, and is obsessed with wolves."
Phoebe Killen
Senior Growth Strategist
"Phoebe is open-minded, optimistic and outgoing. A proponent of balance, she enjoys both historical documentaries and trashy reality shows. You can often find her reading, cooking or walking her cat. (Yes, her cat.)"
Christina Beals
Senior Growth Strategist
"Christina is a creative and ambitious individual who is passionate about journalism and the meaningful impact it has in the world. When shes not working, shes probably out trying new foods, hiking, or spelunking."
Sara Lahr
Senior Accountant
Sara likes her bank reconciliations to be tidy and her sewing table to resemble a FEMA disaster zone. She can occasionally be spotted in community theatre productions and loves a bad movie viewing party.
Bethany Spitzmiller
Managing Editor
"Bethany is most frequently found with her nose in a good book, and she lives for the moments when she finds a typo. She is an avid grammar nerd who typically chooses to opt in for Oxford commas. Aside from punctuation, other passions include traveling, thrift shopping, and board games."
Kirstie Sands
Special Projects Coordinator
"Kirstie, also known as The Jill of All Trades, is a people person who loves making others laugh. When she’s not managing the office, you can probably find her hobby hopping, traveling, spending time with family, or trying new foods."
Olivia Koenig
Account Coordinator
"Olivia is an avid reader and burger lover. You can practically always find her at the gym, or cooking at home. In her free time, Olivia loves to be with her best friend, whose name is also Olivia."
Perfects Place in Our Values
"If theres any place where perfectionism actually belongs, its in how we treat each other. Our strategic advisor, John Hall, never misses a chance to extol the value of helpfulness."
"But just because we care about getting things just right doesnt mean were boring. In fact, we think fun and get-it-right culture bring out the best in each other."
"We celebrate and learn from our mistakes, even though we hate to make them. Friday afternoons at the office often include a movie or Skee Ball tournament. Our Slack is full of puns, pets, and plant care tips."
"Were scrappy, tight-knit, and constantly learning. And we wouldnt have it any other way."

About Blazy
Blazy Founder
"Blazy Susan brand was the brainchild of our founder and CEO, Will Breakell. Will is a young entrepreneur from Roanoke, Virginia. Although Will graduated from the esteemed Virginia Military Institute, he soon realized that he was meant to take a different path than the majority of his peers. The mountains of Colorado were calling for him, and so was the emerging cannabis industry."
Blazy was Born
"One day, while sitting on his couch looking at his cluttered coffee table, Will had an epiphany; thus, the original"
Blazy Susan
"was born. A few short years later, and here we are! The company has grown to reach all over the world, and is revered by our extremely supportive community of customers and fans."
Giving Back
"Blazy Susan wouldnt exist without YOU, so we take pride in giving back to the amazing community. As a brand, we stand for equality and empowerment. We know that the community and industry we are a part of is often unfairly judged and criticized, as are its members. We hope to be a glowing example of how to operate and lead the way in this uncharted territory."

A Pioneer in Warehouse Management for Residential Mortgage Originators
OptiFunder was created to bring mortgage bankers and warehouse lenders together to optimize selection and streamline the historically manual process of funding mortgage loans.
end widget-span

end row-wrapper
THE BIG PICTURE
Simplifying Warehouse Funding
Mortgage bankers rely on multiple warehouse lines of credit for short-term financing to fund mortgage loans until they are sold in the secondary market.
"Each warehouse line has unique terms, capacity limits, and constraints making it difficult for the lenders funding departments to know where to fund each loan."

THE DETAILS
Optimizing Warehouse Allocation Decisioning
Static decision trees and allocator tools are notoriously ineffective and not designed to consider the ever-changing production environment of loans entering the pipeline daily and settling throughout the month.
"OptiFunder solutions help the lender make the optimal decision of where to fund every loan, with submission of data and documents to warehouse partners at the speed of business."

"Established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the SOC 2 examination is designed for organizations of any size, regardless of industry and scope, to ensure the personal assets of their potential and existing customers are protected.

from our founder
"The very first pair of boxer shorts I made were basically just mens boxers with the flap sewn shut. They were far from perfect, but in the process I learned just how many people felt unseen and disempowered by the underwear choices available to them. Since then, Woxer has evolved into a brand thats synonymous with self-empowerment through comfort. But we couldnt have done any of it without our amazing customerswho constantly advocate both for themselves and for Woxers place in the market."
"I created Woxer because I wanted to wear underwear that represented me and actually felt comfortableyet for some reason boxer underwear for us didnt exist. At the time, there wasnt even anything resembling anti-chafing underwear or anti-wedgies underwear on the market."

"""It's all about a focus on creating significant pressure on the bottom of the stack."""
"Marc Ropelato,"
CEO
"NoBid was created in 2019 by three former publishing executives from Purch, Marc Ropelato, Michael Hannon and Reda Guermas. Experts in all things programmatic, they developed a programmatic header bidding technology with the focus of creating significant pressure on the bottom of the stack."
"Using algorithms and numerous server to server demand integrations, NoBid helps to create significant bid density to then monetize impressions that either go unfilled or have been significantly devalued in the market."

Overview
About Us

About Us
"Black Box Safety is authorized by manufacturers to distribute the following safety equipment including eye, face, and head protection; hearing protection; respiratory protection, hand protection, foot protection, and high-visibility garments such as vests and jackets, safety apparel that provides protection from electrical energy (arc flash and arc blast), fire and heat, punctures and cuts, and bloodborne pathogens."
We specialize in the prevention of serious injury in the workplace.
How We Do It
"Black Box Safety gives companies timely access to expertise that existing staff may lack time or skills to supply. It counters the tendency toward one-size-fits-all solutions created when safety managers, who typically make equipment purchase decisions, lack time or knowledge to conduct effective risk assessments or evaluate highly technical products and rely instead on recommendations from distributors of safety equipment."
"Distributors, who do not have daily experience with the company, rely on manufacturers reps for product recommendations, but reps are two degrees distant from the companys actual needs and primarily focused on sales. As each person looks to another for crucial information, detail is lost, increasing the potential for money wasted on solutions that go unused or, worse, provision of insufficient or even incorrect solutions, leading to safety failures."

"Before becoming an entrepreneur, Gatena was an NCAA Champion. In college, he played football for the University of Southern California, where he won a Rose Bowl Championship in 2009, and for UC Davis, where he won a Great West Conference Championship in 2005."
"Gatena started his first company, REP Interactive, at the age of 22.

Michael Lynn is a co-founder of
Pray.com
where he serves as Chief Financial Officer.
Pray.com
"is the worlds #1 app for daily prayer and faith-based audio content, driven by a mission to grow faith and cultivate community. He helped start Pray.com in 2016."
Before joining the
Pray.com
"team, Lynn spent 13 years at Merrill Lynch as a private wealth advisor specifically in the Private Banking and Investment Group (PBIG). In addition, Lynn served as a board member for LAs Best After school Enrichment Program, an organization that brings safe and enriching after-school education and recreation to elementary school children in Los Angeles. Lynn brings expertise in the areas of financial management, political affairs, and asset protection to thePray.comteam."
"Always interested in entrepreneurship but waiting for the right idea, Lynn attended a conference in Santa Monica, Calif., where a panel of entrepreneurs from USC and UCLA shared their stories. Standing out among the panelists was Steve Gatena, fellow co-founder of"
Pray.com
". Lynn introduced himself to Gatena, and they became friends. During the summer of 2016, as they met for pizza, Gatena introduced Lynn to the concept ofPray.com. That very night, because he trusted Gatena and believed in the idea of delivering faith to more people, Lynn decided to leave his career at Merrill Lynch to help foundPray.com."
"Lynn is a confirmed Catholic and values the importance of faith. His time atPray.comhas strengthened his own faith and widened his perspective on prayer, asPray.comis an all-inclusive app that helps everyone make prayer a priority in their life. Developing a core competency in political affairs, Lynn has facilitated conversations between"
Pray.com
"and the President of the United States, the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the Vatican City State. Furthermore,he worked with the Federal Election Commission to issue an opinion that allowed members of the U.S. Congress to appear on"
Pray.com
.
"Born and raised in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Lynn came from a modest, blue-collar family. He was inspired to enter a career in finance after an advisor took advantage of his mother in a poor investment, and he wanted to prevent that from happening to other individuals. Lynn graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a Bachelor of Science in personal finance and then moved to Los Angeles to attend the University of California, where he received his MBA with a focus in finance and concentration in entrepreneurship. Lynn is an avid runner and completed three marathons in 2019 as well as running his own in 2020 amidst the pandemic."

"Ryan Beck is the Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Pray.com, the worlds #1 app for daily prayer and faith-based audio content."
Pray.com
"is driven by a mission to grow faith, cultivate community, and leave a legacy of helping others. Beck brings expertise in computer science, software engineering, and theological studies to his role as chief technology officer. He helped start Pray.com in 2016."
"As with many young people growing up in difficult circumstances, Beck was introduced to drugs, gangs, and violent crime at an early age. Early drug use got him kicked out of school for the first time as a sophomore. Three months before graduating high school Beck was arrested for assault. Upon his release from jail, he began selling drugs, instead of using them. Subsequently, Beck was arrested again, this time for the distribution of narcotics, convicted, and sent to prison. It was in jail that a fellow inmate encouraged him to turn his life around, introducing him to the Bible, and encouraging him to explore his faith in Christ."
"Following his period of incarceration, Beck was given the opportunity to attend Calvary Bible College, where he was able to study theology and nurture his calling to create a Kingdom impact. While he did not feel called to be a minister, Beck did go onto pursue a double-major in philosophy and computer science at Calvin College, where he developed specific skills to serve organizations seeking to serve people at the intersection of technology and faith."
"In 2016, Beck reunited his relationship with Steve Gatena, a childhood friend from middle school, where Gatena shared his vision for a new project he was working on called"
Pray.com
. Gatena invited Beck to join him and fellow co-founders Matthew Potter and Michael Lynn to build Pray.com as the digital destination for faith in 2016. Prior to coming to
Pray.com
", Beck had served as a backend engineer with Mission India."
"Beck is married to his incredible wife, Jeanette, who prayerfully helped him in making the decision to join Gatena and the"
Pray.com
team as a co-founder of what has become the worlds #1 app for daily prayer and faith-based audio content.
"Matt Potter, Founder & Head of Strategic Relationships"
Matthew Potter is a co-founder of
Pray.com
", the worlds #1 app for daily prayer and faith-based audio content, driven by a mission to grow faith and cultivate community. He brings expertise in the areas of strategizing change, building tech products and apps, and finding markets in the continuously evolving technology industry."
"At a time when Potter was looking for ways to give back and become more spiritually connected, he serendipitously ran into his friend Steve Gatena at a coffee shop in Santa Monica, Calif. He could tell Gatena had been struggling and they spoke of the recent loss of his friend and business partner in a plane crash, but how he was beginning to find hope again through prayer. Shortly after that divine run-in, Potter joined forces with Gatena to launch Pray.com, desiring to apply his expertise to do something bigger for theKingdom of God."
"Before Pray.com, while he was still a student at Boise State University, Potter created HomeStack, a white label real estate app. HomeStack launched in 2012 and Potter served as CEO until he stepped down to become a part of the team at"
Pray.com
". Potter continues to serve as Chairman of the Board for HomeStack. In addition, Potter has developed over 6k apps."
"Calling Southern California home, Potter is from Westlake Village, Calif., and enjoys traveling to new countries, investing in real estate, and visiting new sports stadiums. He currently serves on the board of trustees at Southeastern University in Lakeland, Fla. Recently Potter has been featured on multiple podcasts including Seek. Go.

The Inxeption Story
The leader in industrial commerce
"Inxeption is digitizing the global Industrial Commerce value chain through vertical marketplaces for supply chain, powered by a robust industrial search engine and digital infrastructure platform. With Inxeption, suppliers operate a more efficient and connected sales channel, and buyers gain access to vetted sellers, procurement financing and streamlined order fulfillment."
Doing business better from the beginning
"Three veteran software entrepreneurs - Farzad Dibachi, Mark Moore, and Terry Garnett - founded Inxeption on the manufacturing floor of Noribachi, an LED lighting company. It was 2017, and the founders were burdened by the Industrial Commerce status quo: the manual building of purchase and sales orders that were disconnected from downstream fulfillment processes. Seeing an endemic issue in the industry, they started creating the first release of Inxeption, which brought these industrial transactions online."
A history of innovation & challenging the norm
"Inxeption's founders have long been associated with startups and technology. Farzad Dibachi, Mark Moore and Terry Garnett first worked together in the early days of Oracle, where Farzad helped pioneer networking computing. Mark was part of the Oracle Database Kernel Development team,which built the modern version of the Oracle database. Terry served on the Executive Management Committee at Oracle."
"In 1998, Farzad brought Mark and Terry together again to start the Niku Corporation, an IT management and governance software company. Farzad and his team took Niku public on NASDAQ two years later. Niku's value tripled on its first day as a public company. Farzad stepped down as Niku's chairman, CEO and president in 2005 when Computer Associates acquired the company for $350 million."
"Farzad began another business in 2012 - this time with his wife, Rhonda. Noribachi, a custom LED lighting manufacturer specializing in industrial and commercial applications, became the fastest growing LED lighting companies in North America."
Farzad Dibachi
CEO & Co-Founder
Farzad Dibachi was the founding CEO of a series of innovative software companies including Diba and Niku (which Goldman Sachs took public in a $7 billion IPO) as well as the LED manufacturing company Noribachi.
"He began his career at Oracle Corporation, where he rose to senior vice president of Oracle's New Media Division, and he led product development and marketing teams that created the fundamental infrastructure needed to digitize content and distribute it online. He holds a B.S. in mechanical engineering and a B.A. in computer science from San Jose State University."

About Us
"Legendary Lady Labs wasborn out of the need forclean, disruptor-free products that were formulated for women and their unique hormonal needs."
"It all started when Kalli wanted to find a good company to recommend to her millions of followers, but was coming up empty-handed. So instead of compromising on her and her clients healthusing sub-par products, she helped createLegendary Lady Labs."
"Kalli said this when asked about why she started this company, ""I wanted products that not only I would want to use, but that I could also recommend to my own mother. And there just wasn't any company doing it right. So instead of waiting for one to come around, I decided to start one.And with the help of world class formulators and medical professionals, we've created some of the best products around the globe. We scour the globe finding only the best ingredients and suppliers. Then we test relentlessly until we get it right. It's a lot of work and time but knowing that I'm using and recommending the best products for my clients helps me sleep at night."""

Our Story
"In 2020, property managers across the country were struggling keep up with maintenance due to the labor shortage and supply chain disruptions. Enter Lula, whose vendor network and sourcing solutions provided relief for residents and managers all over. The issues that plagued the industry for years were all brought to light when the world shut down due to the pandemic. This disruption provided Lula with a path to reinvent property maintenance forever."
"Once we found where we were most needed and fully committed to servicing rental properties, our core business skyrocketed. In the last 3 years, we grew to over 40 employees, 10x our revenue, expanded to 30+ markets (and counting), were named the top work order management solution of 2023, and ranked in the top 125 of the Inc 5000."

ABOUT US
OUR STORY
"It was 2019 in the hot and humid campus at the University of South Carolina, three college roomates – Addison, Nick and Toby – found themselves restless as their senior year would be over in a couple of months. They knew that soon they would be entering the workforce but weren’t quite sure what they wanted to do as a career. However, they were certain about one thing – they wanted to make an impact."
"Nick had worked around logistics on a couple of occasions and had somewhat of a top level understanding of the industry. Addison, on the other hand, had entrepreneurial experience from starting his own lighting company back in Highschool. Together, one night at dinner in Myrtle Beach, they decided to put their skills and ideas together and give it a go."
"As they started to get to work, they realized they had one last piece of the puzzle missing and brought in Toby who had a Supply Chain background and a knack for sales. They now had the finance know how in Addison, Operations in Nick and Sales in Toby and were ready to go."
"At the start, it was a tough road. They spent countless hours studying the industry’s ins and outs, working day and night to weave networks, systems, and processes into place. Often, they spent more time at their house in Columbia than class, but they were determined to make a name for themselves in the emerging industry."
"It wasn’t long before their hard work started to pay off. Word of their refreshing youthfulness, dedication and attention to detail spread, and customers began to take note. In the beginning, it was difficult to gain the trust of clients, but once they saw the three young entrepreneurs’ work ethic and commitment to the job, everything changed."
"As they pushed further ahead and brought in more and more clients, something interesting started happening. Their customers became more than just customers  they became mentors. These relationships strengthened not only their business but also their connections with people in the industry. They could ask for advice from those who had decades of experience, and they were happy to offer guidance and share their connections with the young entrepreneurs."
"The company began to grow at a rapid pace, thanks to their honest and determined work ethic. The more they worked, the more they learned, the more they excelled. They built a business model that was successful, enabling their clients to put their trust entirely in the hands of their growing team."
"In just four short years, their passion and hard work have transformed their company into an industry leader, quickly becoming one of the fastest-growing private companies in the country. They’ve built upon the firm foundations of their mentors, surpassing their initial goals and aspirations. Hard work and ethics remain the bedrock of their company, and they continue to strive to make an impact in the logistics industry. Today, Addison, Nick and Toby look to continue their growth and feed on their growing hunger in the ever lasting pursuit of perfection."
We have been surrounded by the transportation industry for our entire lives. We have seen the unethical practices of many businesses and watched them fail. Relationships and trust are paramount.

Story Behind the Name: Red Lab
"Red Lab Logistics was named after one of the owner’s dogs, Bently. Bently, a Red Labrador, has been a source of inspiration for the company as he exemplifies qualities that are at the core of Red Lab Logistics’ values. Bently displays unwavering loyalty to his owners and a persistent desire to serve them in any capacity possible. He is also incredibly adaptable, easily modifying his behavior to better serve the needs of those around him. These qualities embodied by Bently have been incorporated into the Red Lab Logistics’ business model, enabling the company to operate with the same level of loyalty, persistence, and adaptability that is demonstrated daily by the well-loved canine that initially inspired the company’s name."

Earth Right Mid-Atlantic
Who Are We?
"Here at Earth Right Mid-Atlantic, our team is focused on giving you the best experience possible, and that starts with honesty, education, and realistic expectations. We are based out of Lynchburg, VA and service folks all over Virginia, from the coast to the hills. Our mission is that through honest and transparent conversations, we make energy efficiency improvements and solar solutions simple and affordable so that you and others can reap the benefits of smarter cleaner energy."
Our Promise
"At Earth Right Mid-Atlantic we believe that honest works reaps honest rewards, and that is why the education and transparent information is a key part to our process. The solar industry is growing fast as people recognize the value of solar, and unfortunately this has attracted some companies looking to make a quick buck. They operate off misinformation or lack of information in order to sell systems that are not accurately sized or reasonably priced. That method is not sustainable and frankly not right. We believe in working with you on customizing packages to exactly what you need; not more and not less. We want you to be informed, do your research, and find what is right for you and your home. We dont want you to just buy an energy efficiency or solar package for your home, we want you to be a part of a growing community that is both saving the planet and saving money by cutting energy waste."

Our Story
Championing Food Inclusivity
"Created in 2016 by Founder and CEO Denise Woodard, when her daughter was diagnosed with multiple food allergies, Partake exists to offer a selection of delicious, allergy-friendly foods that those with and without food restrictions can enjoy and share with confidence. All offerings are certified gluten-free, non-GMO, vegan and are free of the top 9 allergens (wheat, tree nuts, peanuts, milk, eggs, soy, fish, sesame and shellfish)."
Fighting Food Insecurity
"Food allergies affect 1 in 13 children across the country, and (according to foodallergy.org) Black children are at a significantly higher risk of developing these allergies. Passionate about getting safe food into the hands of food insecure families, Partake partners with organizations like No Kid Hungry to provide access to the food, education and advocacy these families deserve."
Opening Doors for HBCU Students
"As a Black & Asian American woman, Denise is passionate about raising awareness of Black and female entrepreneurship and increasing opportunities for underrepresented people seeking careers in the food and beverage industry. In 2020, Denise founded Black Futures in Food & Beverage, an annual fellowship program that mentors HBCU students and helps them secure internships and jobs at the programs end."

Our story
"While volunteering at a nonprofit, Visit.org founder Michal Alter realized that social organizations had a superpower."
"Not only are nonprofits forces for good around the globe, but also the focused nature of their work within specific communities makes them experts in their areas of impact."
"Composed of passionate professionals such as educators, researchers, advocates, community organizers, and change-makers, nonprofits are the only organizations in the public and private sectors that have trusted relationships and deep, culturally informed knowledge of the groups they serve."
"In other words, nonprofits are an untapped resource..."
"With her background in software engineering, Michal believed that technology could bridge this expertise with impact opportunities at scale for corporations, people, and communities worldwide through mutually beneficial experiences."
"Michal founded Visit.org in 2015, launching the world’s first employee engagement provider with social impact experiences at the core."
Visit.org’s mission: Enhance the work of great social ventures.

About Us
About Us
We are siblings and Army Veterans
from Minnesota
We have always supported and encouraged one another during life's journeys.  Now we are thrilled to be working together to run Busy Baby and help make life a little easier for Busy Parents everywhere!
It started over 40 years ago when Beth had to spend her 4th birthday at the hospital when baby Eric decided to make his big entrance the day before her birthday. Throughout the years there were many adventures together from mud races in their home state of Minnesota to a deployment in Kuwait and Iraq together during their time in the army.
"Today they are trying to help each other navigate the ups and downs of running a small business while raising kiddos.  It's not always easy, but they always have each other's back!"

Meet the sisters Behind Baltic Born
Together we started Baltic Born because we were looking for pieces that we felt comfortable in through all the different stages of our lives as women and without breaking the bank.
Meet the sisters Behind Baltic Born
Together we started Baltic Born because we were looking for pieces that we felt comfortable in through all the different stages of our lives as women and without breaking the bank.
"3 Sisters, 1 Goal: To create beautiful and timeless styles that allow all women to be empowered and confident at every stage of life.The Baltic Sea has a history that is entrenched in discovery, war, and rebirth. It has been called a symbol of power, described as the connector for trades, and unites the countries that share the shoreline. 
Through its turbulent history, this body of water continues to unite the people and countries who depend on it for their livelihood."
"As three sisters with Scandinavian heritage, we chose to build a business that celebrated our own history and mirrored the symbolism of the Baltic Sea. We each have navigated life on different paths, in ever-changing bodies, and have loved and celebrated how each of us are so unique. No matter what life has brought us, we are constantly evolving and growing, which has challenged us and brought us closer together."
Shop Baltic Born Exclusives
"We started Baltic Born to empower the women in our community, near and far, to navigate their own path each day at a time. We want our community to feel beautiful, confident and comfortable to conquer their own goals and passions. As a team, we custom design the majority of our pieces with our communitys needs in mind and hand select items from brands and wholesalers that we trust."
Allison
"is the oldest of the three sisters and is a busy mom on the go. Allison's inspiration for Baltic Born started when she and her husband of eleven years began an adventure where in 9 years they lived in 10 cities. She continually was the new-one to the neighborhood, which grew her understanding and need for sisterhood and how important it can be to have a strong bond with her community."
"Each day she motivates the Baltic Born team to be innovative, and keep the customer's needs at the center of all decisions! She loves being a mom and a wife, but the satisfaction she gets from creating designs for women all over the world that make them feel beautiful from the inside out definitely brings tears to her face weekly! Reading all the messages from customers that come in of how beautiful their Baltic Born dress made them feel is the fuel for her work! She loves helping women feel confident and worthy of loving themselves."
What is something you wish everyone knew about Baltic Born?
"Baltic Born is more than just an idea, but rather part of our heritage. Our grandfather introduced us to the industry. As kids we loved to visit him at his men's clothing store. From a young age he would show us how to measure suits, pick fabric, and emphasised the importance of putting the customer first. But this started long before our grandfather, in the 1800s our Scandinavian ancestors were designing and tailoring clothes for their community and even for the Danish king. The birth of Baltic Born was just a matter of time!"
What is something that people dont know about you?
I am bilingual. I had the opportunity to live in Denmark for a year and half and am still fluent in Danish. I absolutely love Danish culture and still host aebleskivers and Christmas dinners focused on all my favorite Danish foods!

Angela
"is the middle sister and has been the driving force behind Baltic Borns growth and passion. Angela is our go-to gal to navigate circumstances where there is no clear path forward, and finds solutions when challenges seem impossible. She is our visionary and is constantly motivating all of us to be the best version of ourselves."
"Angela loves to travel. From one of her first international trips she began noticing the beauty and confidence of a woman on the go. She saw how a simple design and style could make any woman feel confident and empowered no matter the zip code, country code, or terrain. She recognized this confidence as she crossed borders, she saw it in varying body shapes and phases of life. As she herself wears many hats, she knew that this is what she wanted for the customers of Baltic Born."
"Youre called to do something brave, whats the first thing you do?"
"I take a deep breath and think about my son who means the world to me. I always think of how my decisions may impact him. I also might reach for a Diet Dr. Pepper, as that is my go-to destresser then send a group text to the sisters to weigh in. Each of us have incredibly different opinions on almost everything, so I want to make sure I have considered all possibilities. IF theres one thing Ive learned running this business, its that three brains are better than one!"
What is the biggest lesson learned from starting Baltic Born with your two sisters?
"To believe in yourself. Many people do not know that it was a hard path for us to get to where we are now. I know I had many sleepless nights with a newborn as did Allison, and Marianne was essentially working two full time jobs. There were so many times it would have been much easier to give up. But we believed in ourselves, and we pushed each other to keep going even when it got hard. There are definitely days that we did not get along, but at the end of the day we all believe in each other and that will keep us moving forward."

Marianne
"is the youngest sister and is the catalyst of Baltic Borns creativity and style. From a young age, Marianne began dressing up her dolls in chic mix and match ensembles, and fixing their hair to look better. This critical eye propelled her into starting her own successful business and became an award winning hair stylist. As many true artists can see their designs before a single line is put on canvas, Mariannes creativity and eye for detail has propelled Baltic Born into a brand that cannot go unnoticed."
"Marianne has prompted Baltic Born into a space of asking What if? What if we offered bridesmaids dresses in complementary tones for all body shapes and sizes? What if we were to style all of our clothes, so it was easier for our customers to buy and wear? Marianne has pushed the boundaries of how we used to shop for clothes by taking out the guessing game of how will this look on me? and instead used her brilliance to ensure each customer can wear Baltic Borns clothes with confidence."
Give us a snapshot of an ordinary moment in your life that brings you great joy?
"With the hustle of owning a business and working at a fast pace, I really enjoy my downtime. An ordinary moment in my life that brings me a lot of joy is a night in with my husband. Just the two of us, making a home cooked meal together (pasta is our favorite) then relaxing on our couch. I of course need to be wearing a pair of my matching pajamas, and he might be catching up on the days sports highlights. Just thinking of that moment brings me joy."
What is something that people often get wrong about you?
"I tend to observe and listen to the environment around me. I often dont speak up, because I am putting together a puzzle of all the information in my thoughts. So sometimes, people think that I am quiet, but I am often just listening for meaning or intent."

Wire fraud stops with us.
"Were the only company dedicated to preventing real estate wire fraud with advanced software, insurance, and proven recovery services."
Our Vision
A world without wire fraud
Our Mission
To stop wire fraud and keep your money out of the hands of criminals.
Our Values
"Our culture reflects our operating principles, which guide how we deliver value to our customers and their clients."
Protect the customer.
"We are customer-obsessed, but like, not in a weird way. We know how damaging fraud is, so we do whatever it takes to protect our customers' businesses, employees, clients, and money."
Raise the bar.
"Status quo? Never heard of it. We constantly push the envelope through innovation, going the extra mile for our customers and challenging ourselves to improve daily."
Operate with urgency.
Wire fraud stops for no one. We move fast to deliver excellent customer experiences and stay one step ahead of scammers and the competition.
Our Story
"After law school, Tom Cronkright and a classmate founded Sun Title, a title company in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Ten years later, one of their employees wired $180,000 to a fraudulent account. This single case of wire fraud nearly sank the company and changed Cronkrights life forever."
Fighting fraud in court
"There was no clear process for recovering this kind of loss, remembers Cronkright. There was no assistance from federal or state authorities. Our only hope for recovery was through civil litigation. So began a two-year-long effort to recover the stolen money that ended with Tom testifying in front of the US Department of Justice."
"Sun Title went up against a global crime syndicate that was responsible for more than $3B in wire fraud attempts in just five years. Cronkright and his partner managed to recover 78% of the money. But the threat wasnt going away. As digital banking evolved, so would the scammers techniques."
Software that stops fraud
"Sun Title was the target of many more wire fraud attempts. We dealt with spoofed emails, compromised accounts and targeted attacks, says Cronkright. We even had a couple more near-misses. To protect themselves, the Sun Title team developed an app for internal use, and soon realized it was technology they had to share. Tyler Adams joined the company to help Cronkright and the team build an enterprise grade SaaS (Software as a Service) product that changed best practices for the title industry."
"Today, CertifID is the top-rated wire fraud protection software on the planet. And if the unthinkable happens, our fraud recovery team is ready to step in and use its partnership with the US Secret Service to help you recover as much of your money as possible as soon as possible."
"Youll have more questions, and CertifID is here to help!"

Our Team
Our team continues to grow and represents a wide variety of professional and personal backgrounds. But we all share the same goal: to stop wire fraud and keep your money out of the hands of criminals. Were led by a team committed to building the worlds best company for wire fraud protection.
